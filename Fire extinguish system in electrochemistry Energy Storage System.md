# Fire extinguish system in electrochemistry Energy Storage System

The latest regulation demand fire extinguish system in electrochemistry ESS(Energy Storage System). This article simplify introduce the design, flaw and trend of this subsystem.

Lithium-ion battery have a risk of thermal runaway during which release combustable gas and heat. The gas will burn and cause fire. The heat transfer to adjacent cells will cause chain thermal runaway reaction which called thermal propagation.

The fire extinguish system aims to stop the fire and thermal propagation. It will spray fire extinguish substance once thermal runaway event was detected. Commonly, below parts are required:

1. Thermal runaway detection.
2. Fire extinguish substance storage system.
3. Release & Spray device.
4. Emergency shut-down and alarm system.

## Thermal runaway detection
The main phenomenon during cell thermal runaway are:
1. cell temperature rise.
2. cell voltage drop.
3. release gas which consist of CO, CO2, CH4, H2 etc.
4. eject particle smoke & electrolyte fog.

The detection system is designed accordingly:
1. Monitor cell temperature and voltage.
2. Gas sensor, CO, CO2 and CH4 sensor are used commonly.
3. Smoke detector.

### The choice of fire extinguisher
The fire extinghisher shall stop fire and absorb heat from cell. Here list three main types:
1. gas: Expensive, can stop fire but not propagation.
2. Water: cheap, can both stop fire and absorb heat. But it will cause short circuit and totally destory the ESS.
3. Sand: cheap, but can't stop propagation. Hard to spray.
